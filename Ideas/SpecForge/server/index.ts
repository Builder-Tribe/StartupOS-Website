[00:15] Sarah (Interviewer): Thanks for jumping on, Marcus. Can you walk me through what happens when your end-of-month reconciliation fails?
[00:32] Marcus (Head of Finance): Honestly, it is a nightmare. Every single Monday, we waste 2 hours manually downloading CSVs from Stripe and matching them against NetSuite because the webhooks time out silently.
[01:10] Sarah (Interviewer): What do you do when a discrepancy pops up?
[01:25] Marcus (Head of Finance): We have to ping three different engineers on Slack. Our customers get duplicate overdue notices, which ruins our relationship. If a system could auto-detect failed syncs and alert us before invoices go out, I would pay $500 a month tomorrow without blinking.
[02:40] Marcus (Head of Finance): Also, our compliance team requires every manual adjustment to have an audit trail with user email and timestamp. Currently people just edit Google Sheets.

# PRD: Automated Billing Reconciliation & Resilient Webhook Ingestion

## 1. Executive Summary
Eliminate manual CSV reconciliations and prevent embarrassing duplicate dunning notices by establishing an idempotent webhook buffer and automated reconciliation queue.

## 2. Technical Architecture & Data Flow
\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Stripe as Stripe Webhook
    participant Ingest as SpecForge Event Buffer
    participant Queue as Redis / SQLite Queue
    participant Recon as Reconciliation Worker
    participant Ledger as NetSuite Ledger

    Stripe->>Ingest: POST /v1/webhooks/stripe
    Ingest-->>Stripe: 200 OK (Signed & Stored)
    Ingest->>Queue: Enqueue Event ID
    Queue->>Recon: Consume Event
    Recon->>Ledger: Idempotent Ledger Entry
\`\`\`

## 3. Relational Schema & Entity Contracts
- \`webhook_events\`: id, source, payload, signature, status, retry_count, created_at
- \`reconciliation_logs\`: id, event_id, invoice_id, matched_amount, discrepancy, audit_trail_json

## 4. Operational SLAs & Edge Cases
- **Webhook Ingestion p95 Latency:** < 150ms
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Enforce unique constraint on \`stripe_event_id\`
- **Dunning Freeze:** Invoices with reconciliation discrepancy auto-halt automated dunning emails for 48h.
